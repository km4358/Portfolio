                <p id="details">This site was created to fulfill the requirements for my Practicum in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. The objective was
                    to create an interactive web map allowing users to explore the issues surrounding housing affordability in Austin, TX. The web map displays
                    median home costs, racial distribution, undeveloped lots of land, Kirwan Opportunity Index data, and current affordable housing sites.
                    This project utilized Leaflet, a Mapbox tileset, and CARTO databases to store the data.  </p>

                <p id="details">This map is a project from my Graphic Design - Cartography course at UW-Madison. The objective was
                    to create a shaded relief map for a fictional bicycle race using ArcMap and Adobe Creative Suite products.
                    In addition to learning how to successfully manipulate elevation data for shaded relief, this project
                    provided a fantastic opportunity for me to develop my Adobe Creative Suite skills.</p>

                <p id="details">This site was created as a project for the Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. I wanted to create
                    an interactive map using Leaflet to display the rapid population growth taking place in Texas. The site allows the user to manipulate a temporal slider
                    to view the population changes over 5-year increments.</p>

                <p id="details">This map is another project from the Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. The goal was to create an animated and
                    interactive site utilizing D3. The page displays the top wine producing nations between 2000-2014 and provides pop-ups with production figures. </p>

                <p id="details">This map is a project from my Capstone in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. The objective was to create an interactive and mobile-friendly 
                    web page for a local park that allows users to provide input that would be returned to the map for viewing. I utilized a Mapbox tileset, Leaflet
                    controls, and CARTO databases to store and receive data. The site also allows users to use their device location to find the three nearest points of interest
                    in the park.  </p>

                <p id="details">This map is another project from my Capstone in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. We were tasked with developing a standalone application
                        that would perform spatial analysis on water wells and cancer occurrences in the state of Wisconsin. I chose to create a Python based application utilizing a Tkinter
                        GUI. ArcPy code is used for running the spatial analysis, which in this case was Inverse Distance Weighted and Ordinary Least Squares. Once the analysis is completed,
                        the application allows the user to toggle between the resulting analysis maps.</p>

                <p id="details">This map was created during a group project in my Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. The objective was
                        to create a D3 based map like the Wine Production map, but with multiple menu options for the user to select from. This map allows the user to select from different 
                        FEMA declared disaster types and to view their occurrences by state for a selected year.</p>
